# Delivery-Route-Optimization-Modeling
Neural Network and AutoML Implementation on Delivery Route Optimization in Transportation and Logistics industry

### Industry: Transportation and Logistics
### Scenario: Delivery Route Optimization

### Problem Statement:
Effective delivery route optimisation is essential for businesses in the transportation and logistics sector to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and offer consumers timely and dependable service. The challenge is to provide a machine learning-based solution that can precisely forecast and optimise delivery routes, taking into consideration variables like traffic conditions, truck capacity, customer locations, and time slots.

The current method of route planning frequently uses classic optimisation algorithms or manual decision-making, which may not fully take into account real-time data or dynamic aspects. This may lead to less-than-ideal routes, extended journey durations, higher fuel costs, and postponed delivery dates. In order to address these difficulties, a more complex and automated strategy is needed that makes use of machine learning techniques to forecast the best routes based on available data and past experience.

The problem statement calls for solving the following significant issues:

* Data Integration: Data from numerous sources, such as past delivery records, current traffic data, customer locations, time windows, vehicle capacity, and any other contextual data that may have an impact on route optimisation, must be gathered and integrated. To make reliable forecasts, data consistency and quality must be guaranteed.

* Dynamic Factors: Traditional optimisation algorithms frequently have trouble taking into account dynamic factors like traffic jams, road closures, and changes in client demand. Real-time data streams should be incorporated into the system to dynamically update and alter delivery routes in response to shifting conditions, increasing productivity and reducing delays.

* Scalability and Complexity: The solution should be capable of scaling to accommodate huge datasets and a sizable number of delivery locations. The computational difficulty of the optimisation problem increases exponentially with the number of cars and customer locations. Within appropriate timeframes, the machine learning model should be able to process and optimise routes effectively.

* Evaluation of Performance: It is essential to create relevant measures to assess the effectiveness of the optimised routes. Travel time, distance, fuel usage, vehicle utilisation, on-time delivery rate, and general customer satisfaction are some examples of key metrics. The efficacy and advantages of the solution can be evaluated by contrasting the performance of the machine learning-based optimisation with reference cases or existing methodologies.

The transportation and logistics sector has the potential to significantly increase operational efficiency, cut transportation costs, improve on-time delivery performance, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction by addressing these issues and creating a successful machine learning-based delivery route optimisation solution.

### Hypothses of Solution:
It is hypothesised that creating a model for delivery route optimisation can greatly increase operational efficiency, save transportation costs, and boost customer happiness. This is accomplished by utilising machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics. In order to forecast the best routes for the fleet of vehicles, the model will make use of historical delivery data, real-time information, and pertinent contextual elements. These criteria will include traffic conditions, customer locations, time windows, and vehicle capacity.

The premise is that logistics and transportation organisations can get the following advantages by incorporating machine learning methods into the route planning process:

* Enhanced Efficiency: The predictive model will make it possible to identify the routes that are the most effective, cutting down on the time and distance that the trucks must go. The model may reduce idle time and congestion by carefully planning the order of stops and taking traffic patterns into account, which improves operational efficiency.

* Cost savings: By enhancing the delivery routes, transportation companies can save fuel usage and wear and strain on the vehicles. The model can help save money by cutting down on journey distance and minimising pointless detours, which ultimately leads to lower transportation costs.

* Improved On-Time Delivery: The model can forecast and optimise routes to ensure on-time deliveries by taking time frames and customer preferences into account. The model can effectively prioritise routes and distribute resources by taking into account past delivery performance and customer input, which will enhance on-time delivery rates and customer satisfaction.

* Adaptability to Real-Time Changes: According to the premise, the machine learning model should be able to incorporate real-time data streams including traffic updates, client demands, and vehicle availability. As a result, the model will be able to respond to changing conditions and restrictions and dynamically update and change the delivery routes in real-time, providing optimal route planning even in dynamic contexts.

* Scalability and Generalisation: The solution based on machine learning is predicted to be scalable and adaptable to various business settings and delivery scenarios. It is anticipated that the model would generalise well and offer precise forecasts and optimisations for different delivery routes by training it on a variety of historical data and including variables that capture the unpredictability of delivery operations.

### Solution Approach:
The following phases we plan implement in makeing up a delivery route optimisation strategy, according to the problem statement and findings from the studies:

* Data collection: Compiled pertinent information from a variety of sources, such as previous delivery information, traffic statistics, consumer locations, time frames, and other contextual data.

* Data preprocessing: To assure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data, clean and preprocess it. We will take care of missing numbers, get rid of outliers, and standardise the data if required. Create a representation of the data that is appropriate for training and prediction, such as a numerical or categorical one.

* Feature Engineering: To represent the main aspects that affect delivery route optimisation, we will use relevant characteristics that may be extracted from the obtained data. Customer location clusters, traffic patterns, past delivery performance, vehicle capacities, time-dependent features, weather conditions, and customer preferences are a few examples of pertinent features. we will choose the most important aspects, based on incorporating subject knowledge and experience.

* Model Development: Using the prepared dataset, we will develop a prediction model using an appropriate machine learning algorithm or group of algorithms. Reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and neural networks are a few of the frequently used techniques for route optimisation. Based on historical data and contextual knowledge, the model will learn the best routing choices. A portion of the data will be used to train the model, and a separate validation set is kept for performance analysis.

* Real-Time optimization: we intend to implement a Real-time optimisation which involves combining the trained model with a live data flow to continuously update and improve delivery routes. In order for the model to generate dynamic routing decisions, such as traffic conditions, client requests, and vehicle availability we will use api to integrate real-time data into the model. We will implement powerful algorithm to quickly alter the routes based on real-time data processing.

* Performance Evaluation: We will use pertinent indicators, such as trip time, distance, vehicle utilisation, on-time delivery rate, and cost savings, to assess how well the optimised routes work. To evaluate the improvement made possible by the machine learning-based optimisation, we will compare the outcomes to baseline scenarios (such as earlier routing techniques or human planning). To confirm the model's effectiveness and gauge its impact on key performance indicators, use A/B testing or simulations.

### Modeling Approach:
Graph Neural Network (GNN) method will be used. GNNs have demonstrated promising results in a variety of graph-based optimization challenges, and they may also be used to optimize delivery routes.
Here's how a GNN model may help with delivery route optimisation:
1. Representation of Graphs: Make a graph of the delivery network, with nodes representing locations (e.g., customers, depots) and edges representing relationships between places.
2. Node and Edge Features: Assign important features such as geographic coordinates, client demand, distance between sites, and time periods to each node and edge.
3. Graph Convolutional Layers: In the GNN model, use graph convolutional layers to transmit information across the graph by aggregating characteristics from neighbouring nodes and edges. These layers record spatial relationships and enable the model to learn the significance of various nodes and edges in the context of route optimization.
4. Attention Mechanism: Build an attention mechanism within the GNN model to focus on the most important nodes and edges for route optimisation. Customer demand, distance, time periods, and historical trends may all be used to direct attention.
5. Prediction of Routes: Train the GNN model to predict the ideal sequence of nodes (locations) that comprise the delivery route. This may be accomplished by applying a softmax layer to the node representations of the last layer to obtain a probability distribution across the nodes indicating the order in which they should be visited.
6. Training and Optimisation: To train the GNN model, use an appropriate loss function, such as cross-entropy loss. Using gradient-based optimisation techniques such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam, optimise the model's parameters.
7. Real-Time Deployment: Once trained, the GNN model may be deployed in a real-time system that takes real-time updates on traffic conditions, customer demands, and other dynamic aspects into consideration. Based on the most recent information, the model can continually design optimised delivery routes.

Based on the graph structure and related characteristics, the GNN model learns to capture spatial relationships and optimise delivery routes. The model may examine many aspects adaptively to produce effective delivery routes by using graph convolutional layers and attention methods.
Because the use of GNNs in delivery route optimisation is still relatively new, we may need to experiment with different GNN architectures, hyperparameters, and training procedures to acquire the best results. Nonetheless, GNNs' capabilities will make a promising approach to solving the delivery route optimization problem.
