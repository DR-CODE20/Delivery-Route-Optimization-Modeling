# Delivery-Route-Optimization-Modeling
Neural Network and AutoML Implementation on Delivery Route Optimization in Transportation and Logistics industry

### Industry: Transportation and Logistics
### Scenario: Delivery Route Optimization

### Problem Statement:
Effective delivery route optimisation is essential for businesses in the transportation and logistics sector to streamline their operations, reduce costs, and offer consumers timely and dependable service. The challenge is to provide a machine learning-based solution that can precisely forecast and optimise delivery routes, taking into consideration variables like traffic conditions, truck capacity, customer locations, and time slots.

The current method of route planning frequently uses classic optimisation algorithms or manual decision-making, which may not fully take into account real-time data or dynamic aspects. This may lead to less-than-ideal routes, extended journey durations, higher fuel costs, and postponed delivery dates. In order to address these difficulties, a more complex and automated strategy is needed that makes use of machine learning techniques to forecast the best routes based on available data and past experience.

The problem statement calls for solving the following significant issues:

* Data Integration: Data from numerous sources, such as past delivery records, current traffic data, customer locations, time windows, vehicle capacity, and any other contextual data that may have an impact on route optimisation, must be gathered and integrated. To make reliable forecasts, data consistency and quality must be guaranteed.

* Dynamic Factors: Traditional optimisation algorithms frequently have trouble taking into account dynamic factors like traffic jams, road closures, and changes in client demand. Real-time data streams should be incorporated into the system to dynamically update and alter delivery routes in response to shifting conditions, increasing productivity and reducing delays.

* Scalability and Complexity: The solution should be capable of scaling to accommodate huge datasets and a sizable number of delivery locations. The computational difficulty of the optimisation problem increases exponentially with the number of cars and customer locations. Within appropriate timeframes, the machine learning model should be able to process and optimise routes effectively.

* Evaluation of Performance: It is essential to create relevant measures to assess the effectiveness of the optimised routes. Travel time, distance, fuel usage, vehicle utilisation, on-time delivery rate, and general customer satisfaction are some examples of key metrics. The efficacy and advantages of the solution can be evaluated by contrasting the performance of the machine learning-based optimisation with reference cases or existing methodologies.

The transportation and logistics sector has the potential to significantly increase operational efficiency, cut transportation costs, improve on-time delivery performance, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction by addressing these issues and creating a successful machine learning-based delivery route optimisation solution.
